Our startup's name was Otternaut, and it was a smart leads management tool for home service businesses. The purpose was to obtain and nurture leads so that they could be made into customers.

We did have a demo day and had 359 of MRR when I left. The thing is that I felt like a lot of the success was due to my group and I was working on things on the side that never ended up being utilized because we kept pivoting away from what I was building. However I learned a whole heck of a lot as a result of this project and really did put in a lot of time and effort into trying to make it successful and think that I could do much better this time around.

We worked on this from August-April. I was the mobile and backend dev for the project ( so engineer and founder). We had over 20 active user using our service when we left. The other thing is that the group continued working on this project past graduation and I left.

I learned the importance of working on a team in which you respect eachother and have similar goals/values. I also learned the importance of good documentation for our code as our documentation was terrible. I learned how all of the technologies listed above as well as postgresql, supabase, hosting on firebase, Android and Ios development.

It has also inspired me to start my own business with my friend after doing so. He and I have started a website freelancing business and are now creating a business that will move businesses off paper and excel to a database with analytics and easy querying.


The software had over 300 student users.
This was a job for the college. On our team was myself (an engineer), a tech lead, and a product manager. We were working under a professor of Technology Management as a research project.
Yes we had small demos to professors in the Technology Management Department and our software was deployed for all of UVU students and teachers to use. The catch is that I was working on V2 of the frontend, which is going to be deployed very soon but has not yet.

OpenAI's API was powering the chatbot with a FastAPI backend (although I did not write code for the backend). The frontend would send post requests to the backend, which would send other relevant student information to the ai-model. The backend would then catch and resend the stream as it was receving it to the frontend, which would recieve the stream chunk at a time and parse and display it properly.

The Backend (that I did not work on handled all of the authentication by sending cookies from a browser extension to the user who had to be logged into their canvas student portal in order for the tutor to work.

The most challenging part was handling the streaming response, from recieving the data piece at a time (sometimes multiple chunks at a time), and applying the correct regex to them according to the katex and code parsing needs. Katex was very difficult to get to consistently render properly and the code blocks would often have improper syntax sent to me by the llm that I would have to fix. There were many edge cases to handle with all of the parsing. Also the automatic scrolling and stopping was difficult to figure out.



The RIA firm's name is called Elysium, and has offices in Arizona and Utah. I am still working for System8.ai, which is likely going to get swallowed by Elysium and we will all soon start working for Elysium. There are 2 other members that I am working with at System8.ai, although I have been the one handling the part of the operations which I have handled above.

System8.ai is a new startup and does work for hire.

The daily export of prices from the bloomberg terminal is being pulled automatically and is scheduled to run every night at 6pm on Ryan's computer. (He is the Owner of Elysium.)

This removes several minutes every time Excel Spreadsheets is open (which is multiple times a day) and removes ( Having to open the bloomberg terminal and excel, waiting for the data on all the sheets to load, copy-pasting the most recent rows into other programs, and needting to remeber to load this daily. It is also much much faster, has an improved dashboard for viewing, and is easily integratable with other services, easy to expand upon and backtest.

The installer will get used once, but the automation that it performs will be run daily. It is pulling ETF's, Currencies, Futures, and other macro indictator ticker symbols (based on 42 macro).

This is yet to be used by the elysium team but will be used by Ryan daily to provide the entire platform with the data that will be used to analyze the stock market. So The other members of the team will be able to use the data once it is collected as well.

Used the Excel add-in and google-cloud-cli. Also used vbs macro inside excel sheet and all this was done in ps1

The installer has error logging built-in, and the process has error logging as the process is performed daily.

All this was done by testing on a school computer without Administrator rights, which made the whole process much trickier and required many work-arounds for testing and creating a working model.



the excellence & innovation intiative at UVU. The app took the survery results and converted these into metrics used to create teams.

The LLM was used to ask the team creator for specifics on the projects in order to recommend the correct size of the team, correct team members, and best suited roles according to the database of employess and algorithm given to the ai.

I was working with python and steamlit specifically. My job was to trigger an editable table modal on the screen when the ai had enough information to create a team. This modal would then allow the user to edit the team (with a search bar for e2i employees) and removable team members. It would then send the selected team to the database once the user OKed the the team.

I was I frontend Dev on the team.

The 500k was used to fund e2i projects - of either business ideas students had or to pay students to develop software and other tech for real businesses (kickstart contract based work)
