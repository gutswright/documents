Smart Lead Management SaaS for Home Service Businesses ---------------- Aug 2024 â€“ Apr 2025

Built and deployed a cross-platform mobile app (Flutter, FastAPI, Google Maps API) that integrated with the Jobber API to manage real-time customer leads; supported 20+ active users and generated 359 in monthly recurring revenue (MRR).

Standard Activities:
Collaborated in a 3-person founding team

adapting through pivots; gained firsthand experience in agile development, technical ownership, and startup operations.

Led backend development using Docker, PostgreSQL, and OAuth2 authentication; deployed to Hetzner VPS with CI/CD via SSH and Docker Compose.
