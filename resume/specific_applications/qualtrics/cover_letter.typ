Dear Hiring Manager,

My name is Joshua Wright and I'm excited to apply for the position of #EmphasizedWord("Software Engineer I- PAAS.") My background in automation, data orchestration, and full-stack development has prepared me to contribute quickly and effectively to your team.

In my current role as an #EmphasizedWord[Automation Engineer] at System8, Iâ€™ve developed and deployed tools and workflows to manage complex financial data pipelines. Using #EmphasizedWord[PowerShell, Dagster, and Airflow,] I orchestrate daily data refreshes for over #EmphasizedWord[150 ticker symbols,] then visualize results through #EmphasizedWord[Streamlit] dashboards. Each application is deployed via Terraform to #EmphasizedWord[Google Cloud Platform,] ensuring consistency and scalability.

In addition to my current employment, I have #EmphasizedWord[co-founded] two technology ventures -#EmphasizedWord[ RK4 and Otternaut ]- which have given me experience building and deploying scalable applications from the ground up. These experiences included obtaining customers and building trust through the #EmphasizedWord[Agile methodology] loop. Through these roles I have built many websites using #EmphasizedWord[Svelte 5] and handled everything from backend development with #EmphasizedWord[FastAPI] to mobile app development with #EmphasizedWord[Flutter.]

I love to learn new things and be pushed in the workplace and in life. My Cousin, #EmphasizedWord[Daniel Wilkins,] has shared great things about the culture at Qualtrics, and I'm eager to bring my #EmphasizedWord[skills and enthusiasm] for solving hard real-world problems to your team.

Thanks for your time and consideration. I look forward to the opportunity to contribute to #EmphasizedWord[Qualtric's mission.]

Sincerely, \ Joshua Wright
